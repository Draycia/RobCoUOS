# RobCoUOS

RobcoUOS is a recreation of the Robco Unified Operating System from the Fallout series owned by Bethesda Game Studios.
It is meant to be a working and usable operating system that functions as it does in the games (plus some).

This branch is for refactoring to a 32-Bit OS.
Built off of meaty-skeleton from the osdev wiki.
Build instructions will be documented once I streamline them.
